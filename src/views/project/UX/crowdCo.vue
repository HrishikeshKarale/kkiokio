			<h3>About the project</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Overview:</strong>
				The project was a part of VUE + Electron UpLabs Challenge. The end goal
				of the experience was to develop a functioning iOS and Android app using
				the VUE + Electron framework.
				<br />
				Since there was no specific theme defined for the app within the
				challenge, I went on to build a reward based crowdfunding application.
				The main aim here was to spread awareness of this product concept among
				general audience.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Duration:</strong>
				3+ Weeks
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Role:</strong>
				Product design &amp; App development
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Skills:</strong>
				User research, User experience design, User interface design, App
				development using VUE + Electron framework
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution:</strong>
				A functional iOS and Android app that can demonstrate the crowdfunding
				concept to general audience. The app development is in progress.

			<h3>Research and user empathy</h3>
			<p>
				Crowdfunding means relying on the contributions of many to fund charity,
				social or business projects. It offers an alternative to traditional
				funding opportunities for innovative entrepreneurs. Crowdfunding seems
				to work because it eliminates distance-related economic issues such as
				financing and monitoring progress.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started my research by doing a Competitor Analysis in order to prepare
				a list of current reward based crowdfunding players in the market and
				what were the features that they had on offer.
			</p>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
				<p>
					After some browsing and online research, I came to know that there are
					currently two players in the market who are dominating the reward
					based crowdfunding concept â€“ one is Kickstarter and the other one is
					Indiegogo. So I made a list of features that both of them support and
					how they differ from each other.
				</p>
				<vue-img :src="competitor" alt="" />
				<p>
					Probably the biggest difference between the two platforms is their
					approach to money and when you get it. Kickstarter releases funds only
					after the campaign reaches its funding goal (fixed funding), Indiegogo
					provides you with an opportunity to choose between receiving funding
					as it comes in (flexible funding) or waiting to see if you hit your
					target (fixed funding).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h4>App reviews</h4>
				<p>
					After doing the Competitor analysis, I needed more research data on
					these current market players. So I went on Play Store &amp; App Store
					to find out what the daily users of these applications think? After
					all they are the people who are using these apps almost everyday and
					must be knowing what exactly is missing and how to make the current
					platform more usable for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, I could not do research on Indiegogo app as it was not
					available in my country so I went on Kickstarter to see what could be
					found.
				</p>
				<vue-img :src="reviews" alt="" />
				<p>
					I saw so many reviews regarding the comments section within the app
					and how it needs to be improved. But this did not end here, the list
					of <b>pain points</b> mentioned by users in their reviews is
					summarized below:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Content is not well organized. App needs to have a better navigation
					</li>
					<li>
						New users could not find a way to see the list of campaign backers
						in the app. They would like to see it in order to interact with the
						recent backers and ask them whether the campaign is legit.
					</li>
					<li>App needs better way to display campaign categories.</li>
					<li>
						Need better ways to interact with other members on the platform.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Define</h3>
			<q>State your usersâ€™ needs and problems</q>
			<p>
				Based on the competitor analysis &amp; the app reviews that I got from
				play store, I went on to create proto personas as it incorporates the
				needs, goals, and observed behavior patterns of my target audience.
			</p>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h4>Persona</h4>
				<p>
					I decided to create two investor personas. Each persona varied in
					crowdfunding investing experience and as a result they required very
					different pieces of information in order to make their final decision.
				</p>
				<vue-img :src="persona" alt="" />
				<p>
					The first persona was for an inexperienced investor named Greg who is
					new to reward based crowdfunding and wants someone to help him on how
					to invest.
				</p>
				<vue-img :src="persona2" alt="" />
				<p>
					The second persona was for a professional investor named Jennie. She
					has been working as an Angel Investor for the past 10 years and likes
					to help startups who are looking for financial support in order to
					scale their products.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h4>User Stories</h4>
				<p>
					In order to relate to the life of my personas, I ended up writing user
					stories as they would allow me to articulate the userâ€™s perspective
					and generate ideas that fit into the userâ€™s life.
				</p>
				<vue-img :src="userStory" alt="" />
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="Ideation and Prototyping">
			<h3>Ideation and Prototyping</h3>
			<p>
				After defining the needs of my users and documenting what exactly was
				needed to build this product, the next step was to pick up my tools. I
				enjoy this phase because I get to see all my research data getting
				converted into something that people would be able to visualize and then
				provide feedback of what could be done better.
			</p>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
				<vue-img :src="sketch" alt="" />
				<p>
					Keeping the information of both user personas in mind I decided that
					the campaign details displayed on the home screen can be divided into
					three sub-categories: <b>Popular, New &amp; Ending soon</b>. The aim
					of choosing this segregation was to serve both the inexperienced and
					professional investor as per their needs. The campaign description
					screen would display a wide variety of information which all kinds of
					users can explore.
				</p>
				<vue-img :src="sketch2" alt="" />
				<p>
					A better comments section was also the main priority as per the
					research so I took some inspiration from some social networking apps
					in order to see how they handle the comments. Being an active
					Instagram user, I find its comments section to be really neat and well
					organized. So I tried to take some hints and implement it in my app.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h4>High fidelity design</h4>
				<p>
					Usually after paper prototyping I hop on to a digital wireframing tool
					in order to create some low fidelity wireframes. Doing this gives me a
					birdâ€™s eye view of how to structure the information within the
					application and it is easy to iterate quickly. But due to
					<b>time constraints</b> of this project I jumped straight into high
					fidelity design.
				</p>

		<section id="Development & Testing">
			<h3>Development &amp; Testing</h3>
			<p>
				I spent almost 2 weeks to do all the research and designing and this
				meant that I was left with only 1 week to code and set up a basic
				functioning app. The problem was that the app had to be coded using VUE
				+ Electron and I had never used it to code an app before so I had to
				learn the fundamentals as quickly as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is where my software development skills came into picture. Whenever
				a developer is stuck with something and cannot figure out how to move
				ahead, there is this messiah on the internet which goes by the name of
				Stack Overflow ðŸ˜›. The VUE + Electron community there helped me a lot in
				building and iterating on the app quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
				While developing the app it came to my notice that I unknowingly skipped
				one of the most basic design concept mentioned in
				<a
					href="https://developer.apple.com/design/tips/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>iOS HIG</a
				>.
			</p>
			<vue-img :src="app" alt="" />
			<p>
				Apple expects you to keep the text size to be at least 11 pts in your
				apps so that it is easily readable by everyone. I discovered that some
				of the text in my design was less than the default size so I fixed that
				during my development.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="Conclusion & Lessons learned">
			<h3>Conclusion &amp; Lessons learned</h3>
			<p>
				To be honest the app development is still under progress but I am glad I
				took this challenge as it taught me how to manage my time more than
				anything else.
			</p>
			<div class="subSection">
				<h3>What could have been done differently</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						As you can see in my research, I did not conduct any user interviews
						or surveys. This was due to the time constraints for this challenge.
						I was initially planning to do a survey with a specific audience in
						order to get some <b>Quantitative data</b> as it should have given
						me more research insights. But the survey itself could have taken
						some time so instead of doing that I went for the Competitive
						analysis.
					</li>
					<li>
						While making design decisions like app navigation and displaying
						campaign categories, I just went with one option/idea and
						implemented that. Given a chance to do this again, I would think of
						multiple solutions before deciding a single one. Also a proper
						usability testing could have been done before jumping straight into
						development.
					</li>
