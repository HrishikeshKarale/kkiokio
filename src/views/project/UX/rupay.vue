			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>
				I started out solving this task by conducting a research on apps that
				offer a service similar to this to give me a general idea and serve as a
				form of inspiration. I decided to use the color blue as the primary
				color because blue represents trust. For an app that deals with money,
				the most important thing for users is security, they need to know they
				can put their money into the app and it will be secure. I laid out the
				structure based on the features in the brief on paper and decided on how
				the features will connect.
			</p>
			<p>
				Researching on apps that offer a similar service, I was able to conclude
				that users are able to topup their wallets by using their debit cards
				which have been saved on the app or adding a new card and by bank
				transfer
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="App Screens">
			<h3>App Screens</h3>
			<p>
				I put the most important features of the app directly on the homescreen
				so the users don’t have to go through multiple screens to do different
				things. Most of what they need is right there at a glance once they open
				the app. Also, they are able to see their most recent transactions. The
				space for the google ad was also added directly on the homescreen so as
				to be able to reach the users as they open the app rather than put it on
				a separate screen which they might not interact with.
			</p>
			<vue-img :src="homeScreen" alt="" />
			<p>
				Here the users can see both accounts(Naira and Dollar) and their
				respective amounts. The plus icon on each account lets the users know
				they can add(topup) more money to the respective accounts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next set of screens are the Top up, Pay bills and apply for loan
				screens
			</p>
			<vue-img :src="addCard" alt="" />
			<vue-img :src="walletTopUp" alt="" />
			<p>
				They are a number of bills (utility, subscribtions etc.) that could be
				directly paid using a mobile application, so I put them on a seperate
				screen called Bill Pay. I broke them down into their different
				categories to make it easier for the users to pay bills rather than
				scrolling through ten's of options.
			</p>
			<vue-img :src="billPayLoan" alt="" />
			<p>
				Then the loan request page, the users are asked for the amount they want
				and the duration. Based on the process it takes to give a user a loan, I
				added a note to the users to let them know the loan process will take up
				to 6 hours as the information they will be asked to provide will have to
				be verified so they don’t get frustrated. It’s always good practice to
				let different processes take and why.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we were asked to add a feature that enables the users to request
				for a refund but not to make it too obvious, I decided to add it to the
				Profile settings page in the “Help & Support screen”. Also included in
				the Profile settings page is a tab named “Refer and Earn” which enables
				the users to share a link to friends and family to sign up on the app
				and also earn a small token on each successful sign up as an incentive
				to the users.

		<section id="Conclusion">
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				I would not say the user experience fits a description of the “fun”
				mobile application Rupay has tried to position itself as. Some of its
				aesthetics are obviously echoing its competitors, but it is certainly
				more engaging than your run-of-the-mill fintech apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				It will be interesting to see how Rupay evolves, especially with major
				institutions now integrating Rupay’s fundamental functionality into
				their platforms. To combat the tech behemoth entering their space, Rupay
				may have to embrace their social media roots further to differentiate,
				or keep improving on their user experience.
